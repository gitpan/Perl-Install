NAME
    install_perl.pl

SYNOPSIS
    install_perl.pl [-d directory] [-v perl_version] [-m manifest]

DESCRIPTION
    Build a complete Perl and all CPAN modules in the specified directory.
    It takes the name of a directory within which to install Perl. It then
    populates it with everything that you specify.

OPTIONS
    directory (optional)
        This is the directory within which the directory Perl is installed
        will be created. The actual directory will be a subdirectory of this
        with a name of the timestamp of creation. This defaults to '.'

    * perl_version (optional)
        This is the Perl version you wish to install. This defaults to
        'stable'. If you choose to specify a devel version, this script will
        still work as expected. (Tested using 5.9.5 to exercise a bug in
        another module.)

    manifest (optional)
        This is the manifest of CPAN modules that will be passed to
        install_cpan_modules.pl (provided with this distribution). That will
        install all the CPAN modules within the just-built-perl's directory.
        If this is specified, then install_cpan_modules.pl will be called.
        If it is not, then it will not be called. Please q.v.
        install_cpan_modules.pl for the format of this file.
